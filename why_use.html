    <ul>
        <li>
            <font color="red" face="Arial, Heveltica">Google returns the right results first.</font> 
            <br> 
            Google uses a complicated mathematical analysis, calculated on more than a billion hyperlinks on the web, to return high-quality search results so you don't have to sift through junk. This analysis allows Google to estimate the quality, or importance, of every web page it returns. The importance of a web page is entirely independent of any query. A page like <tt>www.google.com</tt> has high importance if
            <ol>
                <li>Other pages with high importance point to <tt>www.google.com</tt></li>
                <li><em>Lots</em> of other pages with high importance point to <tt>www.google.com</tt></li>
            </ol>
            This definition seems circular, and it is. Nonetheless, it yields a well-defined notion of importance that makes finding high quality sites easy. 
            <p>
            Of course, important pages mean nothing to you if they don't match your query, so Google uses sophisticated text-matching techniques to find pages that are both important and relevant to your search. For instance, when considering a page, Google looks at what the pages linking to that page have to say about it.
            </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <font color="red" face="Arial, Heveltica">Google can make you feel lucky!</font>
            <br>
            For common queries like company names, Google is so good at getting the right result first that we've put in an "I'm feeling lucky" button. The "I'm feeling lucky" button takes you directly to the first search result. No more waiting for time consuming search results pages to load when you know what you're looking for.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <font color="red" face="Arial, Heveltica">Google shows you where your query matches.</font>
            <br>
            Instead of static summaries of the web pages, Google gives you an excerpt of the text that matches your query -- with your search terms in bold -- right in the search results! This saves you the time and frustration of loading a web page that ends up having nothing to do with what you had in mind.
        </li>

        <li>
            <font color="red" face="Arial, Heveltica">Google understands that location is important.</font>
            <br>
            Unlike many other search engines, Google tries to return results where your search terms are in close proximity to one another. This is more time-consuming for us, but you spend less time sifting through junk results.
        </li>

        <li>
            <font color="red" face="Arial, Heveltica">Google returns pages with the terms you typed.</font>
            <br>
            Unlike many other search engines, Google only returns pages which match all of your search terms, either in the text of the page or in the link anchors pointing to it. No more frustration with your search terms not even being in the results pages.
        </li>

        <li>
            <font color="red" face="Arial, Heveltica">Google can give you a cached copy of the web page.</font>
            <br>
            Google keeps a copy of many of the web pages it returns. If the server is down or otherwise not available, Google's copy of the page can be a life saver. Using our cached version can often be much faster than following the regular link, though the information you receive will be less up to date. But in many cases, no more frustrating 404 Not Found errors!
